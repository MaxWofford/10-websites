10-websites
===

I'm challenging myself to make 10 websites in 10 days. 

Rules
---
* Templates (ie. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), etc.) are allowed, but I can't use the same one on two different websites.
* I will gladly accept pull requests to improve the quality of past work. Pull requests for work in progress will not be accepted unless otherwise stated.


Notes
---
* Want to use these templates to your heart's content? All websites are licensed under the MIT license. You can do that!
* This won't happen for the weekend after I create this repo, as I'll be busy at [LAHacks](https://www.lahacks.com/).
* The first website will likely be a blog for me to post about my experience over the 10 days I am doing this.
