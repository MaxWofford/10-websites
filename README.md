10-websites
===

I'm challenging myself to make 10 websites in 10 days. 

Rules
---
* Templates (ie. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), etc.) are allowed, but I can't use the same one on two different websites.
* I will gladly accept pull requests to improve the quality of past work. Pull requests for work in progress will not be accepted unless otherwise stated.


Notes
---
* Want to use these templates to your heart's content? All websites are licensed under the MIT license. You can do that!
* I have a [triphasic sleep schedule](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=triphasic+sleep+schedule), so websites might not be finished at exactly midnight. In this case the website must be finished by the time my first cycle of the following day begins.
* This won't happen for the weekend after I create this repo, as I'll be busy at [LAHacks](http://www.lahacks.com/). Check out our [hack](http://tryridr.com/)!
* The first website will likely be a blog for me to post about my experience over the 10 days I am doing this.

Websites
---

* [tryRidr.com](http://www.tryridr.com) This was actually a website I made at [LAHacks](http://www.lahacks.com/), but because it was within the 10 days, I figured I'd include it in this list. Get the template [Here](https://github.com/SlothHacks-2014/tryridr/tree/gh-pages)
* [Day-1](http://maxwofford.com/10-websites/day-1/) This is a landing page for making a mail list. Collecting emails for a startup is probably the best use case, but I'm sure there are other things. Get the template [Here](https://github.com/MaxWofford/10-websites/tree/gh-pages/day-1)
